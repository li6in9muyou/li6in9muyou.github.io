## steps:

0. Clone this repo from GitHub
1. Create a markdown file under `/_posts/`
2. Add article metadata in the very start. Be sure to enclose them with triple dashes
3. Commit then push.

## update:

Steps above worked!

### expected behavior:

- The push to GitHub kicks off a sequence GitHub Action
- The new blog is live at the site
- A [small commit](https://github.com/li6in9muyou/li6in9muyou.github.io/commit/682e485caccb328c7a4595632f69bdd63891ce79) takes about one minute from push to live.
