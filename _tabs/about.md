I am happy to be sad
It's funny when I am mad
I don't really make sense
But I know that that's not bad
I am lonely in a crowd
And I am quiet when it's loud
No I don't know what I want
But I will figure it all out

I like to move around to different beat
I'll walk away then smile in my own street
And I don't really mind when you are fake
'Cause I am me and that's unique

I am living in my own world every day
I'm partly by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that's okay
'Cause I am me and that's unique

I am me and that's unique
